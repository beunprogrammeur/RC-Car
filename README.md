# RC-Car
A prototype for a remote controlled car.


## idea

In this repository, I'm exploring the idea of making a remote controllable car. 

Ideas that come to mind:
* mecanum wheels for driving, steering and stafing
* compass based steering
* "platform" based, allow other computers/chips to steer the car (like a raspberry pi for instance)


for now:
I'm using 
* 4 geared dc motors (N20 motor with some reduction gear on it. according to amazon reviews about 100rpm@3V).
* 2 DRV8833 drivers
* STM32F103c8t (blue pill)
